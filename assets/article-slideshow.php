                Preparation
                1. Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a baking sheet with foil and set a wire cooling rack on top. Set aside.<br>

                2. In a large bowl, toss together the chicken tenders with the seasoning until well combined. Wrap a piece of bacon tightly around each chicken tender, skewering a toothpick on both ends to secure. Place the chicken on the prepared pan and continue wrapping the rest.
                <br>

                3. Bake the chicken until cooked through and browned, about 15-20 minutes. Remove from the oven, and set the broiler to high. Carefully remove the toothpicks from the chicken and place under the broiler until crispy on top, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately or let cool and store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.
